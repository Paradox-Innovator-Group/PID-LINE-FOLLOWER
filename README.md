## Appendix

A line follower bot is a type of autonomous robot designed to follow a line or path on the ground. It typically uses sensors, such as infrared or light sensors, to detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface. These sensors provide feedback to the robot's control system, allowing it to adjust its movement to stay on the line. Line follower bots are commonly used in robotics competitions, industrial applications, and educational projects to demonstrate principles of automation and control systems.
